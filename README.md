# TicTacToe AI

This project implements basic game of TicTacToe with size 3x3. Current version offers 3 opponent types: Human, MiniMax and AI.

## Players

| Name    | Move is determined by              | Opponent |Trainable* |
|---------|------------------------------------|----------|------------
| Human   | clicking on field with mouse       | ðŸ—¸        | â¨‰ |
| Random  | pseudorandom number genrator       | â¨‰        | ðŸ—¸ |
| MiniMax | MiniMax algorithm                  | ðŸ—¸        | ðŸ—¸ |
| AI      | neural network                     | ðŸ—¸        | ðŸ—¸ |

\*Type can be used to train model.

## `model_maker.py`

- Generate data - generate and add data to memory
- Dump data     - Removes data from memory
- Train current model   - Trains `model.h5` with data from memory
- Train new model - Creates new `model.h5` or overwrites current

## `main.py`

In order to run the game you have to create model or import model. Then run script `main.py`.
